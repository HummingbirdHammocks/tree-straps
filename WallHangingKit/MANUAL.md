## GENERAL INFO

The Hummingbird Hammocks Wall Hang Kit is a great way to add a permanent hang location in your house, backyard, office, or anywhere else there are two solid wooden structures. Designed for the rigors of climbing and made entirely from stainless steel, this hang kit is incredibly overbuilt and designed for a lifetime of weather and use.

> This hanging kit should not be used on trees.

## INCLUDED

2 Stainless Steel Climbing Hangers

2 Stainless Steel ⅜"; x 3" Lag Bolts

2 Stainless Steel ⅜" Washers

### Required Tools

- Tape Measure
- Power Drill
- 5/16" Drill Bit
- 9/16" Wrench

## MEASURE

Use your hammock as a guide to figure out a good hang location and spacing. Below are recommended hang width and heights for our hammocks.

| **Hammock Model** | **Width**   | **Height**   |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Single Hammock    | coming-soon | 50" (127 cm) |
| Single+ Hammock   | coming-soon | 50" (127 cm) |
| Double Hammock    | coming-soon | 50" (127 cm) |
| Long Hammock      | coming-soon | 60" (154 cm) |

The numbers above are just guidelines. We recommend setting up a hammock outside using tree straps and finding a comfortable distance for you. It is better to make the anchor points too far apart than too close.

## LOCATE DRILL LOCATIONS

If you are installing this hanging kit on a wall, use a stud finder to locate the center of a stud as close to the ideal mount location as is possible. In the United States, studs are typically located every 16" (on center) but can sometimes be found every 24". If you have to change your hang length to make it to the next nearest stud, move further away from the anchor such that the hang distance is increased. It is better to make the distance too long than too short.

It is very important that you locate a stud for the anchor point. Attaching to drywall or the exterior siding on the house may result in injury and damage to personal property.

If you aren't attaching the anchors to a wall, be sure to select an appropriately thick and well mounted piece of wood.

## DRILL PILOT HOLES

Use the 5/16" drill bit and the power drill to carefully drill a hole at the attachment point. Keep the drill bit at 90 degrees to the wall or post and drill 3" deep.

## ATTACH HANGARS

Pass the lag bolt through the washer and then through the round hole in the hanger hardware. Use the 9/16" wrench to screw the lag bolt into the hole drilled into the wall. Tighten the lag bolt until the hanger comes in contact with the wall and can no longer move. Fully tighten the lag bolt by turning it an additional quarter turn.

## ATTACH HAMMOCK

Attach your hammock to the two, newly mounted hang points using the button links on your hammock. If your hang points are too far away you can add a Tree Strap Extension or an additional button link to make up some extra length.

Please ensure there are no sharp burrs or dirt build up on the hang points. If the hanger is dirty please clean it using any method you choose. If you locate a burr on the hanger, please contact us and we will send you a replacement.
