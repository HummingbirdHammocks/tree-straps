## General Info

Our standard Ultralight Tree Straps may be the lightest (by a fair margin we might add..) but sometimes you need a little more webbing to get around those gorgeous giant trees. For just such an occasion we made the Ultralight Tree Straps+! With an extra 5 feet (1.5 m) of webbing on each strap and crazy strong 1 inch Dyneema webbing, these longer hammock straps have got your back on those tricky hangs.

Just like the original, these straps are designed by an FAA certified parachute rigger using real, certified parachute materials.
